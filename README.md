Every year many people lose their lives due to fatal road accidents around the  world and Drowsiness and Fatigue of drivers are amongst the significant causes of road  accidents. Alcohol, Overwork, Stress, and even Medical conditions can cause drivers  to fall sleep. It is very important to detect the drowsiness of the driver to save life and  property. So to reduce the accidents and save the life of a driver we propose to develop a system called as Driver Drowsiness Detection (D3 ) system. This system can  automatically detect driver drowsiness in a real-time video stream and then play an  alarm if the driver appears to be drowsy. Haar Cascade classifier, facial landmarks and  computing Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR) to ensure proper detection of drowsiness in order  to avoid accidents. For implementing this system we used libraries like Opencv and dlib.
